# Adaptive Traffic Signal Simulation

This project simulates an adaptive traffic signal system at a four-way intersection using Python and Pygame. The simulation dynamically adjusts signal timings based on real-time vehicle density and type, aiming to reduce congestion and optimize traffic flow.

## Features

- Four-way intersection with independent signals
- Vehicles of different types (car, bus, truck, rickshaw, bike)
- Dynamic green light duration based on vehicle count and class
- Realistic vehicle movement, lane management, and turning logic
- Visual display of signals, timers, and vehicle counts

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/adaptive-traffic-signal-simulation.git
    cd adaptive-traffic-signal-simulation
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install pygame
    ```

3. Ensure the `images/` directory contains required vehicle and signal images.

## Usage

Run the simulation:
```sh
python [simulation.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/0)
